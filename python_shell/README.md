# psh - a combined python and linux shell

All commands not executable in python will be executed in linux shell.
Use `$` at the start of the line for inline execution of python code.

## installation

`chmod +x psh.py && sudo cp psh.py /usr/bin/psh`

## setting as default shell

I would not recommed setting this as default shell.
